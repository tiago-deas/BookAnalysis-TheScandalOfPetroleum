# BookAnalysis-TheScandalOfPetroleum
Project about the most common relevant words and short phrases in The Scandal of Petroleum book written by one of the most important and famous writers from Brazilian literature, Monteiro Lobato. Lobato criticized the way Brazilian oligarchs were working closely with some American geologists to hide oil reserves in the Brazilian territory.  In my analysis, I developed bags of words and word clouds that showed the most common relevant words in the book. Moreover, I found and analyzed the most correlated words in Lobato's work and the findings were very interesting.
